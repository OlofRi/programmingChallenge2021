# programmingChallenge2021
A Machine Learning Programming Challenge through University.

The challenge consisted of predicting labels for a given evaluation dataset with as high accuracy as possible. Around 80% accuracy and above would be provided with maximum score.
No additional information was provided than the output format (text file with label in each row corresponding to predicted label for given evaluation data).
The time frame was one week.

Data for training and evaluation was provided. Any tool was allowed to solve the challenge.
My solution received an accuracy score of 0.736 which corresponded to (17/18) points.
